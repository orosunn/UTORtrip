# UTORtrip

## Description
Technology often falls under two categories; inovation and iteration. We were motivated to iterate on existing innovations in a way that brings convenience and simplicity. While travelling, we often use one tool for translation and one tool for calculating currency exchange. We sought to bring these two innovations together in a simple, yet effective tool. We learned the importance of collaborating ideas and skillsets. That team problem solving brings abundance.

### Installation
Just vist "insert deployed link"

### Usage
This app was designed with a common scenario in mind. Being in a foreign country and needing to look up what a street sign reads, or the value of a store item. Upon initialization users can check the current rates of key currency pairs below the header. The "Currencies" dropdown selector has a list of currencies that can be calculated in CAD. Enter the value of the currency and press the "Exchange" button to convert the value. The "Languages" drop down allows users to pick which language they would like to translate into english. Enter the words to be translated into english. Press the "Translate" button to output the translation.
